# react-native-techstack-redux

A quick project on learning to use react native by creating an albums application.

## Tech utilised:
* React Native (well, duh)
* React
* Redux

## Concepts hopefully grasped:
* using Redux: actions, reducers, action creators
* mapping Redux state to props using connect and mapStateToProps
* modify state of items in store
* use animations and transitions
* using <ListView> for efficient rendering
